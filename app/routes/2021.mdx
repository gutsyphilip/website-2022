# Thankful Regardless
In many ways when I think of this year, there‚Äôs so many reasons why my year in review letter should bear a mellow and somewhat solemn tone. But I think that‚Äôs the interesting thing about storytelling. There‚Äôs multiple narratives to the same sequence of events depending on your vantage point. I‚Äôve decided to make mine one of acceptance and gratitude. So join me as I recount the things I am grateful for in hopes that you can do the same for yourself too.


## People

I am grateful for people. I started out the year living most of my life in seclusion, not that that has changed now. But thankfully, there were moments where I chose to go the extra mile, moments where I decided to do something seemingly ‚Äúout-of-character‚Äù and I met really amazing people. I‚Äôll like to specifically appreciate some of the key people I met this year and I hope that doesn‚Äôt bore you. In truth I didn‚Äôt meet these people this year, but the relationship that now exists between us was formed this year and it‚Äôs wild thinking about that.

There‚Äôs many things I should be grateful for when it comes to you but amongst other things, I didn‚Äôt realize there was a reality where I had a flatmate and didn‚Äôt feel miserable. Thanks for brainstorming tons of ideas with me, many of which may never come to life, but that‚Äôs ‚Äúthe concept‚Äù. The one‚Äôs that will, will and they‚Äôd be fucking amazing. I would be insane to not point out that you cared for Mylo(my dog) more than I could on many occassions and I am massively greatful for that. That guy get stress sha. I hope in many ways I was able to incite some excitement and passion in you as you did in me.

### Darah Ahmed
I‚Äôve alwas had issues with maintaining friendships. With most of my friends, I‚Äôm that rich uncle that pops up during christmas, checks on your wellbeing and gives loads of presents. It‚Äôs never really been what I wanted, but I accepted the dynamic as most people actually preferred things that way. Reach out when I‚Äôm needed otherwise nothing. You offered true friendship to me in ways. Despite all the times I would snap back into character and lock everyone out focusing only on my work. You were truly different and I want you to know that I appreciate that from the bottom of my heart. I sadly have a tendency to not show these things in the ways that people would expect. That‚Äôs not an excuse eitherway. Thank you for being a crucial part of the mental stability I felt this year and I hope I did the same for you too in some way ü§û.

I can by no means create an exhaustive list of all the people that made my year what it was. Some I would eventually thank in private. But to everyone who made this year what it was, I say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. To both the friends lost and friends found.


## My career

This year, I got the opportunity to explore my creativity through several outlets. This was extremely pivotal for me and was the singular reason for the immense amount of learning and creating I was able to do this year.

### Software Engineering
I started out the year doing the highly impactful work of leading the Frontend team at Brass. I was work that I was truly proud to be part of at felt like I could apply myself to meaningfully create a difference. At the start of the year I was presented a new role offering over 10x my salary at Brass at a leading video editing software company. I was to join a software engineer leading the newly birthed API product. While my focus was with Brass, I took the job at the time for financial purposes. After three months, I decided to leave the job and focus on Brass despite the lower pay as I knew there was alot to be done and I felt uniquely poised to take things on in the way that I could.

I remained at Brass until the later parts of the year, eventually transitioning into a Technical Product Manager role, where yet again I led the Apps & Integrations team to

Lesson: Never commit to doing work that you know that you are truly not giving your best. It gets frustrating, breeds resentment and ultimately often never ends well. Leave when it‚Äôs time to. Make a hard cut. No half-arsing.


Although to me, my career is very much beyond making money from doing work that provides value to someone. I guess it still remains a significant component.
